          <h2>About this project</h2>
          <p class="lead">The discipline of Classics is concerned with the study of cultures, languages, art, and literatures of ancient Greece and Rome. Reception studies are concerned with the interpretation and use (including abuse) of ancient Greek and Roman cultural and material artifacts in historical and modern contexts. Though reception studies have traditionally been concerned with the interpretations of classicists and students, classics scholars have increasingly given attention to the interpretation and use of classical culture by far-right political groups in the United States. Such groups, believing Greek and Roman cultures to exclusively constitute white Western heritage, use classical history, images, and writings to legitimize their social and political ideologies. As these groups have become increasingly visible and violent in the past decade, their misappropriation of classical culture has begun to receive critical response from classics scholars. Such responses have also had the effect of foregrounding disagreements among scholars.<br><br>
This project is interested in tracing the public conversation between far-right and white supremacy groups in the United States and classics scholars, some of whom vehemently criticize their interpretation and use of classical culture and materials as inherently inaccurate and immoral. The project will index several accounts of far-right or white supremacist uses of the classics and the critical scholarly response, visually tracing these instances of critique and counter-critique to contextualize each event. This project is intended to be an information tool for public interest as well as a teaching tool that can be used to help promote classroom discussion about political reception of the classics in the United States and discussion of issues within the discipline of Classics.

              <h3>Donna Zuckerberg calls for Classicists to Respond on <i>Eidolon</i></h3>
                <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Leighton_Helen_of_Troy.jpg" width="250" height="400" align="left" style="padding-right: 10px"; "padding-bottom: 10px";><p><font size="2"><i>Helen on the Walls of Troy</i>. Frederic Leighton.</font></p>
                <p>In her 2016 article, written shortly after the election of Donald Trump, Donna Zuckerberg, Classics scholar and founder and editor-in-chief of the now-archival Eidolon online publication, responds to the increasing use of the Greco-Roman antiquity by alt-right groups to amplify a rhetoric of anti-feminism, racism, and white supremacist ideologies. Greece and Rome of antiquity are seen by alt-right groups as the foundation of a Western Civilization propagated solely by powerful white men. The discipline of Classics has been historically white and, although beginning to diversify, there has been a reluctance to let go of the narrative of superior cultural value and racialized claims to classical heritage. Zuckerberg’s 2016 article is a self-stated “call to arms for all classicists”, inciting Classicists to speak out against instances of white supremacist alt-right adoption of the Classics. But why? As her article details, the alt-right’s use of materials and personas from classical antiquity are decontextualized and self-serving. Such groups use classical antiquity to promote the rhetoric that racism and misogyny are a natural and necessary part of society where white men rule. Zuckerberg refers to this as the “self-mythologizing of the alt-right,”: focusing on the elite male characters of antiquity, while ignoring women, children, slaves, and any social or cultural context. The idea of masculinity as the foundation of the West is popular with alt-right groups, who have recently been validated by the election of Trump and now have a political and platform and social space to spread their classically infused rhetoric.
Zuckerberg urges classicists that it is their social responsibility to actively speak out against such cooptation and use their expertise to push back against alt-right receptions of the Classics. Responding to questions of what Classics scholars can really do, she suggests that scholars challenge the viewpoints of their colleagues and students on why studying Classics is important and what it means to a contemporary world; focus their scholarship on the marginalized in antiquity and cite other scholars who do so; and most importantly, refuse to create content for alt-right audiences and instead engage with their problematic representations of the classical antiquity.

                    <p><i>Pharos</i> is a thorough repository cataloging and responding to appropriations and misrepresentations of antiquity by hate groups in the United States. The site was founded by Curtis Dozier, a Classics scholar at Vassar College, in the year following Donna Zuckerberg's article "How to be a Good Classicist under a Bad Emperor". Dozier <a href="https://eidolon.pub/doing-justice-to-the-classics-24a22893a054">talks about how the site came to be</a> in a post on <i>Eidolon</i>. The site is a collaborative project, relying on individual reports and scholars to volunteer their time and expertise to address the many misrepresentations of antiquity spread online by hate groups. Dozier notes that the purpose of the site is not necessarily to change the minds of hate group members, but to be a present voice in the online world that actively pushes against false historical narratives. In essence, <i>Pharos</i> is a response to Zuckerberg's call for classicists to speak to a public audience as a way of combating hate group appropriations of antiquity. The site is currently up to date. Visit Pharos <a href="https://pages.vassar.edu/pharos/">here</a>.</p><br><br>
                      <h3>Dorothy Kim on Medieval Studies and White Supremacy, August 28, 2017</h3>
                      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Jheronimus_Bosch_011.jpg" width="250" height="400" align="left" style="padding-right: 10px"; "padding-bottom: 10px";><p><font size="2"><i>Ship of Fools</i>. Hieronymus Bosch.</font></p>
                        <p>Medievalist Dorothy Kim’s 2017 piece on the medieval studies blog In the Middle gained both positive and negative attention from fellow scholars. Kim is a professor of English at Brandeis University, and her work focuses on race, gender, digital humanities, medieval women’s literary cultures, and the alt-right, among other interests (Brandeis.edu). Writing on the problematic presentation of historical materials that have been used to incite violence, Kim challenged teachers to take a look at their pedagogical practices and ask themselves whether they were actively disengage medieval materials from white supremacy and use in racist rhetoric. Citing the fondness that white supremacy groups, such as those in the Charlottesville riot, have for medieval history, she foregrounds the necessity of addressing these kinds of uses of history in the university setting. This is a critical step for scholars to take, and as Kim notes: “medieval studies is intimately entwined with white supremacy and has been so for a long time,” and that educators need to be aware of this culture in order to protect “BIPOC, LGBTQUA, Jewish, Muslim, differently abled, and female students,”. Reflecting the call from Donna Zuckerberg in her 2016 Eidolon publication, Kim’s challenge to scholars and educators is to be openly and actively against white supremacy in the classroom and for that to be clear to students.

                          <h3>Rachel Fulton Brown Attacks Dorothy Kim, September 14, 2017</h3>
                          <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Conjurer_Bosch.jpg" width="400" height="250" align="left" style="padding-right: 10px"; "padding-bottom: 10px";><p><font size="2"><i>The Conjurer</i>. Hieronymus Bosch.</font></p>
                            <p>Rachel Fulton Brown, a professor medieval history at the University of Chicago and far-right sympathizer railed against Dorothy Kim’s 2017 article calling for university educators to signal to students that they are not white supremacists in a response on her personal blog, Fencing Bear at Prayer. Using a tone of mock outrage, Fulton Brown attempts to take Kim to task for calling medievalist educators to take a stance against problematic white supremacy in the discipline by pointing to an antiphonal verse honoring the Virgin Mary that says she is “black but beautiful” and to a stained-glass window at the cathedral of Chartres in France that she interprets as portraying the Virgin Mary as black. She goes on to argue that medieval Christians did not care about race and makes this into a rhetorical turn to show that her being a medieval scholar is then itself proof that she isn’t a white supremacist. Her final declamation is to liken herself to the Virgin Mary: “Professor Kim wants you to be afraid. I don’t. I want- like Mary- for you to know that you are loved and the God so loved the world that he gave his Son in sacrifice that the world might be remade,” (emphasis in original). In addition to a baffling argument, Fulton Brown also makes textual and visual reference to Dr. William Chester Jordan, a medieval scholar of color, to prove that the discipline is not associated with white supremacy. Additionally, she posts at the head of her response a photo of Dr. Kim, which raises questions about the intentions of her post and whether this was an attempt at doxxing. Fulton Brown has long been deeply associated with the far-right public figure Milo Yiannopoulos, and has written for Breitbart, putting her squarely in the company of the alt-right and white supremacy. Her response garnered a significant amount of attention and was written about shortly afterwards by Donna Zuckerberg on Eidolon.

                                <p>Not a month after Fulton Brown posted her response to Dorothy Kim’s article on the issues of white supremacy in medieval studies and how the subject is taught in the classroom, Donna Zuckerberg responded in an article on Eidolon calling Fulton Brown’s post an attack on Kim and highlighting the ways that the post was problematic and unlike typical academic discourse, linking to the critiques of other scholars. Zuckerberg devotes the remaining article to a discussion of expertise and how engagements with alt-right and white supremacists are defined by a denial of expert scholarship and scholars, often through the practice of violent trolling. Her point stands, that correcting the mistakes that white supremacists make when they adopt medieval and classical materials, language, and personas is an ineffective tactic. As she says, the idea that educating white supremacists is ineffectual because the choice to interpret medieval and classical history is “an ideologically driven choice”. Zuckerberg’s discussion of expertise reinforces that the alt-right’s denial of legitimate scholarly expertise is incredibly powerful and difficult to address from a logical standpoint, as calling them out when they are wrong will not affect a change of their views. But creating such a discourse is meaningful in other ways, namely, to bring into critical conversation and examining the origins and representations of official histories. Returning to Fulton Brown’s response to Dorothy Kim, Zuckerberg suggests that Fulton Brown was incited to write her post out of a feeling of being called out. Her response, which began with a mockery of Kim as a person of color, was most about proving how she herself was not complicit in perpetuating white supremacist use of medieval history in their violent rhetoric.

                                    <p>In her article, “Classics and the Alt-Right: Historicizing Visual Rhetorics of White Supremacy” Morse parses the rhetorical messages utilized by <a href= “https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2017/09/26/identity-evropa-and-arktos-media-%E2%80%94-likely-bedfellows”>Identity Evropa</a> in their campaign for white supremacist ideologies on college campuses, including the University of Michigan, in 2016. The campaign, #ProjectSiege, was a recruitment effort put into action of college campuses aimed at white students. #ProjectSiege was done by posting flyers promoting white supremacy on an estimated 41 different campuses. Some of the flyers had photos of statues of Hercules and Apollo Belvedere with slogans such as “Protect Your Heritage” and “Our Future Belongs to Us”.  Part of the alt-right Identity Evropa relies, as many other alt-right groups and figureheads, on the “imagined genealogy”, as Morse says, that claims Greek and Roman history and heritage as exclusively white, European heritage. Morse notes, as have many others, that the use of Greek and Roman statuary as proof of white supremacy has a long history beginning in scientific racism, and these sources are still cited by white supremacist groups like the alt-right today. And as classical art and writing are imbued with cultural authority, the pairing of the images of Greek and Roman statuary and propagandistic rhetoric send messages to incite action. Understanding the social and cultural power of these rhetorics, Morse echoes earlier sentiments that classicists must take responsibility to respond to racist uses of Greco-Roman culture and create a more public discussion regarding the diversity of classical reception.

                                          <p>Denise McCoskey addresses the history of how classical antiquity has been racialized in the west, leading to the current appropriations and misrepresentations of classical materials by the alt-right and other white supremacy and hate groups. Such groups have embedded classical antiquity into their imagery, slogans, and personas to legitimize their political movements, harass minority groups and <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/for-one-scholar-an-online-stoning-tests-the-limits-of-public-scholarship/"> scholars who oppose them</a>, and to justify violent behavior. McCoskey writes, specifically, about the turn in 18th and 19th century classical reception from a diverse cultural inheritance to racially exclusionary inheritance. To contextualize this, she gives a history lesson in what is known through art and writing about the social and cultural perceptions of race and understandings of human-environmental interactions in ancient Greece. As McCoskey iterates throughout the article: whiteness was not a concept used in ancient Greek and Rome.
Conceptions of race as biology in the west are tied to colonialism and to early scientific studies of human anatomy. McCoskey notes that the field of classics was concurrently emergent with changing ideas of race in the U.S., and this is when a leap was made in the perception of classical antiquity, and statuary in particular. Classical statuary was held up as representative of past perfection, their contemporary counterpart in European and early American views being people of European descent. This parallel marks a significant distortion and racialized antiquity to support narratives of the racial superiority of Europeans. Using the lens of race to understand classics has precipitated modern discourse on eugenics and promoted notions of some races as dangerous to Western civilization (itself a <a href= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/09/western-civilisation-appiah-reith-lecture> social construction</a>). Given that the concept of Western Civilization as white-led global progress strongly permeates the social and political landscape in the U.S., McCoskey advocates for critical attention to ideas of race within the Classics.

                                                <p>Following a presentation by Dan-el Padilla Peralta on the inherent and problematic white male hegemony in the academic discipline of Classics, independent classicist Mary Frances Williams was forced to stop speaking and leave the “Future of Classics” panel during Q&A at the 2019 Annual Meeting of the Society for Classical Studies. Williams was directed out after diverting the panel discussion by arguing for a defense of a traditional Classics pedagogy that need not recognize feminist or racially diverse scholarship. Williams argued that the “classic Classics” have been cast aside in favor of women’s studies and ethnic studies courses in the discipline, implying that the latter do not have the same merit as the corpus of ancient Greek and Roman writers and philosophers. At her assertion that Classics is important because it is “Western Civ”, panelist and feminist classicist Sarah Bond interrupted her to argue that Classics is not, in fact, “Western Civ”. As Williams continued to argue that traditional Classics materials have merit without needing to address women’s and ethnic studies, Bond interrupted her to note that she was only listing works written by men. Williams reinforced her view that the value of scholarship and, presumably, historical works, was based solely on merit. At fever pitch, Williams pointed to panelist Dan-el Padilla Peralta, a highly respected Princeton classicist, and remarked that “You may have gotten your job because you are Black,” but that she preferred to think that he got his job because of merit. At this, several in attendance convened upon Williams while Peralta responded that if the discipline of Classics comes to stand for Williams' values, his hope would be for the swift death of the field. After being removed, Williams was informed that she would no longer be welcome to participate in the SCS. Additionally, Sarah Bond was formally reprimanded by the SCS for what they referred to as unprofessional behavior when she interrupted Williams. Williams, Bond, and Padilla have all written in response to this incident- as have numerous other scholars.</p><br><br>
