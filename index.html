          <h2>About this project</h2>
          <p class="lead">The discipline of Classics is concerned with the study of cultures, languages, art, and literatures of ancient Greece and Rome. Reception studies are concerned with the interpretation and use (including abuse) of ancient Greek and Roman cultural and material artifacts in historical and modern contexts. Though reception studies have traditionally been concerned with the interpretations of classicists and students, classics scholars have increasingly given attention to the interpretation and use of classical culture by far-right political groups in the United States. Such groups, believing Greek and Roman cultures to constitute Western heritage, use classical history, images, and writings to legitimize their social and political ideologies. As these groups have become increasingly vocal and publicly visible in the past decade, their misappropriation of classical culture has received critical response from classics scholars.<br><br>
This project is interested in tracing the public conversation between alt-right and white supremacy groups in the United States and classics scholars, who vehemently criticize their interpretation of uses of classical culture and materials as inherently inaccurate and immoral. The project will provide an account of of alt-right or white supremacist uses of the classics and the critical scholarly response, visually tracing these instances of critique and counter-critique to succinctly contextualize each event. This project is intended to be an information tool for public interest as well as a teaching tool that can be used to help promote classroom discussion about political reception of the classics and its use in sociopolitical discourse.

                      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Jheronimus_Bosch_011.jpg" width="250" height="400"><p><i>Ship of Fools</i> by Hieronymus Bosch</p>
                        <p>Medievalist Dorothy Kim’s 2017 piece on the medieval studies blog In the Middle gained both positive and negative attention from fellow scholars. Kim is a professor of English at Brandeis University, and her work focuses on race, gender, digital humanities, medieval women’s literary cultures, and the alt-right, among other interests (Brandeis.edu). Writing on the problematic presentation of historical materials that have been used to incite violence, Kim challenged teachers to take a look at their pedagogical practices and ask themselves whether they were actively disengage medieval materials from white supremacy and use in racist rhetoric. Citing the fondness that white supremacy groups, such as those in the Charlottesville riot, have for medieval history, she foregrounds the necessity of addressing these kinds of uses of history in the university setting. This is a critical step for scholars to take, and as Kim notes: “medieval studies is intimately entwined with white supremacy and has been so for a long time,” and that educators need to be aware of this culture in order to protect “BIPOC, LGBTQUA, Jewish, Muslim, differently abled, and female students,”. Reflecting the call from Donna Zuckerberg in her 2016 Eidolon publication, Kim’s challenge to scholars and educators is to be openly and actively against white supremacy in the classroom and for that to be clear to students.</p><br><br>
                          <h3>Rachel Fulton Brown Attacks Dorothy Kim, September 14, 2017</h3>
                          <img src=""><p></p>
                            <p>Rachel Fulton Brown, a professor medieval history at the University of Chicago and far-right sympathizer railed against Dorothy Kim’s 2017 article calling for university educators to signal to students that they are not white supremacists in a response on her personal blog, Fencing Bear at Prayer. Using a tone of mock outrage, Fulton Brown attempts to take Kim to task for calling medievalist educators to take a stance against problematic white supremacy in the discipline by pointing to an antiphonal verse honoring the Virgin Mary that says she is “black but beautiful” and to a stained-glass window at the cathedral of Chartres in France that she interprets as portraying the Virgin Mary as black. She goes on to argue that medieval Christians did not care about race and makes this into a rhetorical turn to show that her being a medieval scholar is then itself proof that she isn’t a white supremacist. Her final declamation is to liken herself to the Virgin Mary: “Professor Kim wants you to be afraid. I don’t. I want- like Mary- for you to know that you are loved and the God so loved the world that he gave his Son in sacrifice that the world might be remade,” (emphasis in original). In addition to a baffling argument, Fulton Brown also makes textual and visual reference to Dr. William Chester Jordan, a medieval scholar of color, to prove that the discipline is not associated with white supremacy. Additionally, she posts at the head of her response a photo of Dr. Kim, which raises questions about the intentions of her post and whether this was an attempt at doxxing. Fulton Brown has long been deeply associated with the far-right public figure Milo Yiannopoulos, and has written for Breitbart, putting her squarely in the company of the alt-right and white supremacy. Her response garnered a significant amount of attention and was written about shortly afterwards by Donna Zuckerberg on Eidolon.</p><br><br>
                              <h3>Donna Zuckerberg responds to Rachel Fulton Brown’s blog post, October 5, 2017</h3>
                                <p>Not a month after Fulton Brown posted her response to Dorothy Kim’s article on the issues of white supremacy in medieval studies and how the subject is taught in the classroom, Donna Zuckerberg responded in an article on Eidolon calling Fulton Brown’s post an attack on Kim and highlighting the ways that the post was problematic and unlike typical academic discourse, linking to the critiques of other scholars. Zuckerberg devotes the remaining article to a discussion of expertise and how engagements with alt-right and white supremacists are defined by a denial of expert scholarship and scholars, often through the practice of violent trolling. Her point stands, that correcting the mistakes that white supremacists make when they adopt medieval and classical materials, language, and personas is an ineffective tactic. As she says, the idea that educating white supremacists is ineffectual because the choice to interpret medieval and classical history is “an ideologically driven choice”. Zuckerberg’s discussion of expertise reinforces that the alt-right’s denial of legitimate scholarly expertise is incredibly powerful and difficult to address from a logical standpoint, as calling them out when they are wrong will not affect a change of their views. But creating such a discourse is meaningful in other ways, namely, to bring into critical conversation and examining the origins and representations of official histories. Returning to Fulton Brown’s response to Dorothy Kim, Zuckerberg suggests that Fulton Brown was incited to write her post out of a feeling of being called out. Her response, which began with a mockery of Kim as a person of color, was most about proving how she herself was not complicit in perpetuating white supremacist use of medieval history in their violent rhetoric.</p><br><br>

                                              <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lcJZCVemn-4?start=1904" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>
                                                <p>Following a presentation by Dan-el Padilla Peralta on the inherent and problematic white male hegemony in the academic discipline of Classics, independent classicist Mary Frances Williams was forced to stop speaking and leave the “Future of Classics” panel during Q&A at the 2019 Annual Meeting of the Society for Classical Studies. Williams was directed out after diverting the panel discussion by arguing for a defense of a traditional Classics pedagogy that need not recognize feminist or racially diverse scholarship. Williams argued that the “classic Classics” have been cast aside in favor of women’s studies and ethnic studies courses in the discipline, implying that the latter do not have the same merit as the corpus of ancient Greek and Roman writers and philosophers. At her assertion that Classics is important because it is “Western Civ”, panelist and feminist classicist Sarah Bond interrupted her to argue that Classics is not, in fact, “Western Civ”. As Williams continued to argue that traditional Classics materials have merit without needing to address women’s and ethnic studies, Bond interrupted her to note that she was only listing works written by men. Williams reinforced her view that the value of scholarship and, presumably, historical works, was based solely on merit. At fever pitch, Williams pointed to panelist Dan-el Padilla Peralta, a highly respected Princeton classicist, and remarked that “You may have gotten your job because you are Black,” but that she preferred to think that he got his job because of merit. At this, several in attendance convened upon Williams while Peralta responded that if the discipline of Classics comes to stand for Williams' values, his hope would be for the swift death of the field. After being removed, Williams was informed that she would no longer be welcome to participate in the SCS. Additionally, Sarah Bond was formally reprimanded by the SCS for what they referred to as unprofessional behavior when she interrupted Williams. Williams, Bond, and Padilla have all written in response to this incident- as have numerous other scholars.</p><br><br>
